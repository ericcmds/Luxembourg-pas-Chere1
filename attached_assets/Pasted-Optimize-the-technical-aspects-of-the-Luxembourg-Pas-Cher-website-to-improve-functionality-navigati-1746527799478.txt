Optimize the technical aspects of the Luxembourg Pas Cher website to improve functionality, navigation, and overall performance. I've noticed several technical issues including non-functional buttons and navigation problems. Make the following improvements:

1. Fix navigation functionality:
   - Repair the anchor link system so clicking on menu items smoothly scrolls to the correct sections
   - Implement proper URL hash management so direct links to sections work correctly
   - Add active states to navigation items to indicate current section
   - Make the logo link back to the homepage
   - Create a persistent navigation bar that remains visible when scrolling

2. Fix non-functional buttons and interactive elements:
   - Implement proper functionality for the "COMMANDER" button to open a purchase modal or link to purchase page
   - Add click handlers to "Sélectionner" buttons in the crowdfunding section to capture selection
   - Make "Participer au crowdfunding" button functional with a form submission or external link
   - Ensure "Découvrir" buttons under thematic sections link to appropriate content pages
   - Fix social media icon links to open in new tabs

3. Ensure complete mobile responsiveness:
   - Replace the current basic responsive setup with a comprehensive mobile-first approach
   - Create a proper mobile navigation menu with hamburger toggle for smaller screens
   - Ensure all clickable elements are minimum 44×44px on mobile for touch accessibility
   - Test and optimize for a variety of devices (iPhone, Android, tablets) and orientations
   - Prevent horizontal overflow issues on mobile devices

4. Optimize page load speed and performance:
   - Implement lazy loading for images below the fold
   - Minify and concatenate CSS and JavaScript files
   - Optimize image file sizes and formats (use WebP with JPEG fallbacks)
   - Implement proper browser caching with appropriate headers
   - Add preload directives for critical resources
   - Ensure Core Web Vitals compliance (LCP, CLS, FID)

5. Add proper hover states and transitions:
   - Create consistent hover effects for all interactive elements
   - Implement focus states for keyboard navigation
   - Add transition effects for state changes (hover, active, focus)
   - Ensure hover states provide clear visual feedback on desktop
   - Add touch feedback effects for mobile users

6. Implement proper language switching functionality:
   - Fix the language toggle in the navigation
   - Ensure content changes appropriately when language is switched
   - Store language preference in localStorage for returning visitors
   - Implement proper hreflang tags for SEO

Additionally, add appropriate error handling for any interactive elements, ensure cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge), and implement proper semantic HTML throughout the site for accessibility and SEO benefits.
