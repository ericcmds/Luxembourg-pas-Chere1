Book Description:

Our guide is unique, being the only one to compile all the information needed to save money. This makes it useful and valuable for readers.

The guide has a triple objective:

Help families in precarious situations maintain their dignity by becoming active in finding solutions to their financial difficulties and managing daily life.
Save families time by providing all the information they need in one place.
Encourage responsible consumption by promoting the social and solidarity economy.
The guide offers accessible information on resources that help with frugal consumption and budget management. It provides a unique platform presenting the Grand Duchy (tourism, social, cultural, etc.) from the perspective of economic accessibility for all.

About the Project Leader:

My name is Pascale ZAOUROU. I am a single mother of three children, aged 49, with a degree in Educational Sciences and a diploma in Social Sciences and Mediation. I have been a resident of Luxembourg for over fifteen years. This project is based on my personal experience, followed by interviews with students, single-parent families to learn about their best tips, and discussions with associative leaders and key players in Luxembourg's social and solidarity economy.

Context:

Today, 45% of workers in Luxembourg come from across the borders, and 75% of the active population is non-native. We also address the issue of working poor. Various health, climate, and security crises have weakened household budgets. The phenomenon of working poor has intensified in Luxembourg. While the country aims to attract talent, the high cost of living hinders its appeal. A thorough market study reveals current gaps in information on affordable tips and consumer needs, as well as access to social measures. On average, between 50% and 80% of potential beneficiaries do not have access to social measures because they are not informed.

Target Audience:

Local residents concerned about managing their budget
Students, young professionals
Budget travelers
Municipalities
Social services
Human resources departments
Non-resident expatriates
Companies featured in the first edition
Companies concerned with CSR in the banking or consumer sectors
Ministries
Temporary employment agencies
Daycare centers
Real estate agencies
Innovation:

The project's innovation lies in several aspects:

The diversity of topics covered. Our project is the only one to address all areas of daily life: finance, culture, furniture, entrepreneurship, food, contributing to lower household expenses and offering an economic solution alternative.
A response to the high cost of living in Luxembourg
