Perform a comprehensive quality assurance review of the e-commerce checkout process for our digital guide product. Please verify both the logical flow and functional integrity of the entire purchase journey, focusing on the following critical areas:

1. STRUCTURAL ASSESSMENT:
   - Evaluate if the user flow follows a logical sequence from "Commander" button to purchase confirmation
   - Verify each step naturally leads to the next with clear directional cues
   - Confirm that the progress indicator accurately reflects the user's position in the checkout flow
   - Assess if important information is presented in a logical hierarchy on each screen

2. FUNCTIONAL VERIFICATION:
   - Test each interactive element (buttons, form fields, dropdowns) to confirm proper functionality
   - Verify all payment method options are selectable and lead to appropriate payment flows
   - Confirm that discount codes apply correctly and update pricing in real-time
   - Test form validation for proper error handling and user feedback
   - Verify the final submission process correctly processes the order

3. RESPONSIVE DESIGN TESTING:
   - Check functionality across different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
   - Confirm that all elements remain clickable and properly sized on mobile devices
   - Verify that text remains readable at all breakpoints

4. EDGE CASES TO TEST:
   - User attempts to navigate backward/forward during checkout
   - Session timeout behavior
   - Form submission with invalid data
   - Network interruption during payment processing
   - Multiple rapid clicks on submission buttons

5. SECURITY VERIFICATION:
   - Confirm that secure connection indicators are present
   - Verify that sensitive form fields (credit card information) have appropriate security measures
   - Check that payment processing follows standard security protocols

Please document any issues discovered using the following severity classifications:
- Critical: Prevents purchase completion
- Major: Causes significant user frustration but purchase is possible
- Minor: Cosmetic or small usability concerns

For each issue, please provide:
1. Specific location/step where the issue occurs
2. Expected behavior
3. Actual behavior
4. Screenshots or specific descriptions
