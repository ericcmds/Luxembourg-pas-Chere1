Enhance the visual design of the Luxembourg Pas Cher website while maintaining its budget travel theme. The current site has a basic layout with some inconsistencies in spacing and visual hierarchy. Implement the following improvements:

1. Create a modern, responsive layout using CSS Grid and Flexbox that:
   - Maintains a clean, airy feel with consistent padding and margins (20px-40px) throughout
   - Implements a proper responsive design with at least 3 breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop)
   - Uses consistent container widths with max-width properties to prevent overly stretched content on large screens

2. Establish a consistent, visually appealing color scheme:
   - Keep the existing light blue primary color (#00A4E0) but create a more cohesive palette
   - Add a complementary secondary color (consider a warm accent like #E31837 for CTAs)
   - Define a consistent set of neutral colors (white, light gray, dark gray) for backgrounds and text
   - Implement these colors using CSS variables for easy maintenance

3. Improve typography:
   - Maintain the current font families (Montserrat for headings, Open Sans for body text) but implement a clear type scale
   - Create a typographic hierarchy with 4-5 heading sizes plus body text styles
   - Increase line height to 1.5-1.6 for better readability
   - Ensure adequate contrast between text and backgrounds (minimum 4.5:1 ratio)

4. Enhance image display:
   - Implement proper responsive images with srcset attributes
   - Add subtle shadows or borders to images for depth
   - Create consistent image aspect ratios within each section
   - Add hover effects for interactive images
   - Optimize the book cover display with a subtle 3D effect

5. Improve visual hierarchy:
   - Create clear visual separation between sections with subtle dividers or background color changes
   - Highlight the most important elements (book promotion, crowdfunding section) with prominence
   - Use whitespace strategically to guide the eye and improve content organization
   - Ensure CTAs stand out with contrasting colors and hover effects

6. Add subtle animations and transitions:
   - Implement smooth scroll behavior for anchor links
   - Add fade-in effects for images and content sections when scrolling
   - Create hover animations for buttons and interactive elements
   - Keep animations subtle and performance-focused

The overall aesthetic should feel professional yet approachable, conveying the idea of smart budget travel rather than cheapness. The design should highlight the value proposition of saving money while enjoying Luxembourg's offerings.
